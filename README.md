# MultisnipOCR
## Multi-platform shortcut snipping tool to copy text through an OCR engine to the clipboard
## Multi-platform & multi-lingual shortcut snipping tool to copy text through an OCR engine to the clipboard
#
This project was inspired by the windows shortcut WIN+SHIFT+S which allows users to quickly screenshot a portion of the screen to their clipboard.
The idea is to replicate this but instead of copying the image, pass it through an OCR engine and copy the text.

  - Full multiplatform support (installers and further testing)
